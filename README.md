# Run

You'll need a YouTube V3 Data API Key which you can read more about here: [https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)

Then, edit `config.example.ts` and replace the `"YOUTUBE API KEY GOES HERE"` with your API key. Save the file as config.ts.

Then:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then visit localhost:3000

## To edit styles, in a seperate tab:

```
npm run styles
```
